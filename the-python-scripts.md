project_analyzer.py - The detective that crawls your project and finds issues
smart_file_organizer.py - The helper that fixes things based on what the detective found
run_analysis.py - The simple interface that runs everything with one command

🚀 Step 1: Quick Setup
Save these files to your scripts/ directory, then run:
bashcd ~/lesson_plan_App
python3 scripts/run_analysis.py
This will:

✅ Analyze your entire project
✅ Show you exactly what's wrong and why
✅ Let you choose: analyze only, dry run, or fix automatically
✅ Handle the shell script syntax error by avoiding shell scripts entirely!

🔍 What the Python Detective Finds
The analyzer looks for:

JSX patterns in .ts files (should be .tsx)
React imports without proper extensions
Component patterns that need TypeScript React
Smart destination suggestions for your downloads folder

🎯 Why This is Better Than Shell Scripts

Flexible: Adapts to your actual code content, not rigid rules
Safe: Shows you what it will do before doing it (dry run mode)
Smart: Understands React/TypeScript patterns
Mac M3 Compatible: Pure Python, no shell syntax issues
Reusable: Can run this across multiple projects

📋 Your Next Steps

Save the three Python files to your scripts/ directory
Run the analyzer: python3 scripts/run_analysis.py
Choose option 2 (dry run) to see what it would fix

If you like the suggestions, run again and choose option 3
