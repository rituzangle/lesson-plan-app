// This config defines the sidebar structure for the documentation.
// Each entry corresponds to a document in the `docs` directory.
// The order of entries determines their position in the sidebar.   
// You can nest items by creating arrays within the main array.
// For example, to create a nested structure, you can do:
// module.exports = {
  docs: [
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Getting Started',
      items: [
        'intro',
        'project_guide',
      ],
    },
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Guides',
      items: [
        'style_guide',
        'comment_cheat_sheet',
      ],
    },
    ],
// };
// };
// This allows for better organization of related documents under a common category.
// You can add more categories or documents as needed.
// Each document should have a corresponding Markdown file in the `docs` directory.
// The sidebar will automatically reflect the structure defined here.
