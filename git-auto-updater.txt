 script that automatically commits artifacts to your GitHub repo as they're completed

This would prevent the conversation length problem and give you a nice version history.

Not at all! That's exactly the kind of thoughtful, professional approach that makes projects maintainable and scalable. Think of it like building a well-organized digital workshop - every tool has its place, every process is documented, and you can pick up where you left off months later without missing a beat.
Here's what I'll implement for you:
Auto-GitHub Integration:

Script that commits each artifact with structured comments
Clear project hierarchy paths in commit messages
Dependency tracking per component

Built-in Standards:

Accessibility-first (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
GDPR/privacy by design
Security & encryption defaults
Inclusive design patterns

Future-proofing:

Compatibility checks in all scripts
Version management
Health check systems
Documentation that stays current

set up the full automation pipeline (GitHub sync, modular architecture, accessibility features) and we can continue building from where you left off.
