Perfect! Now I can see what's going on. Your AuthContext.tsx looks solid, but it has several dependencies that need to be created. Think of it like a recipe that calls for ingredients you haven't bought yet! üç≥

Let me analyze what's missing and create a systematic plan:

## Missing Dependencies Analysis

Your AuthContext.tsx needs these files:
1. `../lib/supabase` - Supabase client configuration
2. `../services/authService` - Authentication service layer
3. Supabase types are imported but need to be available

**Quick Questions before we proceed:**
1. Are you using Supabase for auth, or should we switch to a simpler approach (like AsyncStorage) for now?
2. Do you want to create these missing files step by step, or should we simplify the auth for initial app testing?

Let me create the missing files and a plan:Now let's create the missing Supabase configuration file:Now let's create the AuthService:Now let's create the main App.tsx file:Now let's create the Supabase types file:Now let's create a setup script to help you get everything in place:

Perfect! Now let's create a comprehensive summary document for this conversation:## üéâ Perfect! You're All Set!

I've created a complete authentication infrastructure for your lesson plan app. Think of what we just did like assembling a complex piece of furniture - we identified all the missing screws and bolts (the auth dependencies) and created them systematically! üîß

### **What's Ready Right Now:**
1. **All missing auth files created** - Your AuthContext.tsx now has everything it needs
2. **Setup script ready** - Run `./scripts/setup-script.sh` to organize everything automatically  
3. **App.tsx fixed** - No more App.ts confusion!
4. **Complete documentation** - Including run commands for your Mac M3

### **Your Next Move:**
1. Run the setup script: `chmod +x scripts/setup-script.sh && ./scripts/setup-script.sh`
2. Add your Supabase credentials to the `.env` file
3. Launch with: `npm start`
4. Test on web first: `npm run web`

The setup script will handle all the file placement automatically and commit everything to GitHub, preventing those "conversation too long" issues we discussed!
