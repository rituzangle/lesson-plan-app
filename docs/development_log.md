# Development Log

## Project: Lesson Plan App
**Repository:** `rituzangle/lesson-plan-app`  
**Started:** July 8, 2025  
**Developer:** @rituzangle  

## Session 1 - July 8, 2025

### Project Initialization
- ✅ Created project structure and architecture
- ✅ Defined modular approach with React Native + Python backend
- ✅ Established privacy-first, GDPR-compliant design
- ✅ Outlined comprehensive feature set

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: Modular, privacy-first approach
2. **Tech Stack**: React Native (Expo) + TypeScript + Python backend
3. **Storage**: Local-first with optional cloud sync
4. **Target**: K-12 education (parents, teachers, students)
5. **Approach**: "Patience of grandmother, focus of professional teacher"

### Features Defined
- **Multi-user support**: Parents/guardians and teachers
- **Adaptive learning**: AI-powered content generation
- **Comprehensive subjects**: STEM, Arts, Languages, Life Skills, Coding, AI
- **Break management**: 3-4 minute breaks with activity suggestions
- **Assessment engine**: Adaptive testing and progress tracking
- **Export functionality**: PDF generation for offline use
- **Privacy compliance**: GDPR, COPPA, FERPA adherence

### Next Steps
1. Initialize Expo project
2. Set up GitHub repository
3. Create basic navigation structure
4. Implement user onboarding flow
5. Build lesson planning MVP

### Technical Notes
- **Message size issue**: Resolved by creating modular artifacts and GitHub sync
- **Platform targets**: iOS, Android, Web (PWA), Microsoft Surface
- **Documentation**: Full commenting and modular architecture.md
- **Automation**: Scripts for code upkeep and deployment

## Session 2 - [Next Session]

### Planned Activities
- [ ] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository structure
- [ ] Create basic navigation and routing
- [ ] Implement user type selection (Parent/Teacher)
- [ ] Build child setup flow
- [ ] Create basic lesson planning interface

### Code Generation Strategy
To avoid message size issues:
1. Create small, focused modules
2. Use artifacts for code chunks
3. Auto-sync with GitHub
4. Maintain comprehensive documentation

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Document features and architecture
2. **Implementation**: Create modular components
3. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Inline comments and README updates
5. **Deployment**: Automated scripts and CI/CD

## Repository Structure Status

### Completed
- [x] Project architecture documentation
- [x] Directory structure planning
- [x] Development workflow definition
- [x] Technology stack selection

### In Progress
- [ ] Expo project initialization
- [ ] GitHub repository creation
- [ ] Basic component structure

### Pending
- [ ] User interface design
- [ ] AI integration
- [ ] Assessment engine
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Privacy compliance implementation

## Key Reminders for Next Session

1. **GitHub Username**: `rituzangle`
2. **Repository**: `lesson-plan-app`
3. **Platform**: Mac M3 with GitHub authorized
4. **Preferences**: 
   - Modular approach
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Step-by-step implementation
   - TSX/React Native focus
   - Privacy-first design

## Questions for Next Session
1. Should we start with user onboarding or lesson planning core?
2. Which subject should be the MVP focus?
3. Do you want to implement AI features from the start or add later?
4. Should we create the Python backend alongside or frontend-first?

## Code Generation Notes
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow React Native best practices
- Maintain clean, commented code
- Create reusable components
