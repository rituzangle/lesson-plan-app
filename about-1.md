all artifacts have:
✅ Clear file paths - Know exactly where each file goes
✅ Auto-install dependencies - Self-healing npm scripts
✅ Import references - See what depends on what
✅ Setup script - Complete project initialization
To implement:

Save the setup script to scripts/setup.sh
Make it executable: chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
Run setup: npm run setup
Place files in their designated paths:

src/database/schema.ts
src/database/testDatabase.ts
src/components/UserOnboarding.tsx



The setup script automatically:

Creates folder structure
Installs dependencies
Updates package.json scripts
Creates .gitignore and README

Ready for next step?
A) Navigation setup - Connect onboarding to main app
B) Main dashboard - Post-onboarding experience
C) Test implementation - Verify everything works
